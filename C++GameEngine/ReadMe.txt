This is the folder for my basic c++ game engine.
My task was to improve the existing basic engine that my lecturer created.
This included creating an objectmanager, game objects and all game object files.
I created a basic game of asteroids in the game to demonstrate the engine working.
The engine has been created "purposely rubbish" as described by my lecturer as it was made to help with the understanding of pointers.
I have uploaded the header and class files along with any resource files along with the class and sequence diagrams.
All my edited and created files have been commented at the head of the file with the user name "w16014375"
